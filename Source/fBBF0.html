	<h2>MadhyamakÄvatÄra: Collection of Reasoning</h2>
<p><em>Oral commentary by Khen Rinpoche Namdrol</em></p>
<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>Please listen to this explanation with the supreme motivation of bodhicitta, wishing to attain perfect awakening for the sake of all sentient beings.</p>
<h3>Introduction to the Text</h3>
<h4>The Collection of Middle Way Reasoning</h4>
<p>The great master Ärya NÄgÄrjuna was prophesied by the Buddha himself in the <em>Root Tantra of MaÃ±juÅrÄ« (MaÃ±juÅrÄ«mÅ«la Tantra)</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Four hundred years after I,<br/>
The TathÄgata, have passed away,<br/>
A monk called NÄga will appear<br/>
Who will benefit my teachings.<br/>
Reaching the bhÅ«mi of Perfect Joy<br/>
And living for six hundred years,<br/>
This great being will perfect<br/>
The science of the great peacock,<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a><br/>
And will understand the meaning of various ÅÄstras<br/>
And the meaning of the absence of reality.<br/>
When he leaves behind his mortal body,<br/>
He will be reborn in SukhÄvatÄ«.<br/>
And ultimately, he will certainly gain<br/>
he perfect fruit of buddhahood itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He was also prophesied in the <em>Great Cloud SÅ«tra (MahÄmegha-sÅ«tra)</em> and the <em>SÅ«tra of the Great Drum (MahÄbherÄ«hÄrakaparivarta-sÅ«tra)</em>.</p>
<p>Ärya NÄgÄrjuna's two main treatisesâthe so-called âbodyâ treatisesâare <em>Root Verses on the Middle Way (MÅ«lamadhyamakakÄrikÄ)</em> and <em>Sixty Verses on Reasoning</em>. The text we are concerned with here is the <em>Introduction to the Middle Way</em> ( <em>MadhyamakÄvatÄra</em>) by Candrakirti, which is a commentary on the meaning of the <em>Root Verses</em>.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, NÄgÄrjuna composed treatises on all five sciences. Those on the science of the inner meaning, i.e., the Buddhadharma, primarily teach the aspects of view and conduct. In describing the view and the conduct of the Dharma, NÄgÄrjuna employs both scriptural quotations and reasoning. The treatise that mostly uses quotations from the scriptures is the <em>Compendium of SÅ«tras (SÅ«trasamuccaya)</em>. It draws from the sutras in order to explain and clarify the aspects of view and conduct.</p>
<p>There are three collections that mainly employ reasoning in order to clarify the view and the conduct of the buddhist teachings. They are the Collection of Reasoning, the Collection of Praises and the Collection of Advice.</p>
<p>The Collection of Praises relates mainly to the final turning of the Wheel of Dharma. It includes eulogies in praise of the ground, the path and the fruition.</p>
<p>The Collection of Advice relates mainly to the first turning. It includes the advice to the king known as the <em>Precious Garland</em><a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[2]</a> as well as the <em>Letter to a Friend</em>.<a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[3]</a></p>
<p>According to some past scholars the Collection of Reasoning was originally referred to simply as âthe collectionâ or âthe teachingsâ of logical reasoning and the number of texts it contained was not specified. Others, such as Mabja Changchub TsÃ¶ndrÃ¼<a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[4]</a> and the omniscient Gowo Rabjampa,<a href="#fn:5" id="fnref:5" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[5]</a> insist that the Collection of Reasoning contains a specific number of texts. They differ in the texts they identify; yet they agree on the principle that the number of texts in the collection is fixed.</p>
<p>Mabja Changchub TsÃ¶ndrÃ¼ said that the Collection of Reasoning contains six texts. Among these, he said, two texts are likened to the body, and this is clear because it is stated so in CandrakÄ«rtiâs commentary to <em>Sixty Verses on Reasoning</em>. The two body-like texts are <em>Root Verses on the Middle Way</em> and <em>Sixty Verses on Reasoning</em>. In addition, Mabja Changchub TsÃ¶ndrÃ¼ goes on, there are four branch or limb-like treatises. He claims that this derives from CandrakÄ«rtiâs <em>Commentary to the Sixty Verses on Reasoning,</em> where it is explained how these four texts are elaborations upon the two fundamental treatises. However, this text only describes <em>Refutation of Objections</em><a href="#fn:6" id="fnref:6" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[6]</a> and <em>Seventy Stanzas on Emptiness</em><a href="#fn:7" id="fnref:7" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[7]</a> as extensions of the main two treatises. It does not mention <em>Crushing to Fine Powder</em><a href="#fn:8" id="fnref:8" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[8]</a> or <em>Conventional Existence,</em><a href="#fn:9" id="fnref:9" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[9]</a> which are the other texts Mabja Changchub TsÃ¶ndrÃ¼ includes among the collection.</p>
<p>Gorampa disagrees with Mabja Changchub TsÃ¶ndrÃ¼ because of this very point. It is clear, he says, that <em>Refutation of Objections</em> and <em>Seventy Verses on Emptiness</em> are branch-like treatises, because the way in which they are extensions of the main two treatises is clearly explained. As for <em>Crushing to Fine Powder</em>, Gorampa believes that it too may be counted as a branch-like treatise, and in this it seems he is in agreement with many past scholars. He also agrees that the main topic of <em>Crushing to Fine Powder</em> is the refutation of the so-called âsixteen topics (Skt. <em>padÄrtha</em>) of the dialecticians.â As the text itself says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With the pride of intellectual knowledge,<br/>
They seek to engage in debate.<br/>
In order that they might relinquish such pride,<br/>
I shall explain the <em>Crushing to Fine Powder</em>.<a href="#fn:10" id="fnref:10" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[10]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, <em>Crushing to a Fine Powder</em> is included among the branch-like treatises.</p>
<p>Mabja Changchub TsÃ¶ndrÃ¼ includes <em>Conventional Existence</em> among the branch-like treatises. This is because the teachings of the <em>Root Verses of the Middle Way</em> on how all phenomena are naturally beyond arising and empty might cause one to doubt whether all phenomena are non-existent even at the conventional level, rather like the horns of a rabbit or the horns of a donkey. Therefore <em>Conventional Existence</em> was taught, it is said, in order to dispel this misunderstanding, and to show how at the conventional level all phenomena are illusory and dream-like. So Mabja Changchub TsÃ¶ndrÃ¼ claims that there are six texts in the Collection of Reasoning, and that one of them is <em>Conventional Existence</em>.</p>
<p>The Omniscient Longchenpa also states that there are six texts in the Collection of Reasoning, the sixth being <em>Conventional Existence</em>.</p>
<p>Gorampa disputes the inclusion of <em>Conventional Existence</em>. In the first place, he objects to this on the grounds that it was not translated into Tibetan. He goes on to say that it probably did not exist even in India because CandrakÄ«rti fails to mention it at the end of his <em>Clear Words</em><a href="#fn:11" id="fnref:11" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[11]</a> commentary upon the <em>Root Verses on the Middle Way</em> when listing all the Madhyamaka texts that he had studied. If <em>Conventional Existence</em> really was the work of NÄgÄrjuna, Gorampa argues, then CandrakÄ«rti would certainly have studied it. This is the relevant section of <em>Clear Words</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What I have shown here is based on my study of the <em>Compendium of SÅ«tras</em>, the <em>Advice of the Precious Garland</em> and <em>In Praise of the Authentic</em>, and also, for a long time and with great effort, the <em>KÄrikÄs</em> from the treatise of Ärya [NÄgÄrjuna] , and the <em>Sixty Verses on Reasoning, Crushing to Fine Powder</em> and <em>Seventy Stanzas on Emptiness</em> as well as <em>Refutation of Objections</em> too. I also looked into the <em>[Four] Hundred Verses</em> and so on, and many profound sutras, as well as the commentary composed by BuddhapÄlita and that which was well explained by BhÄvavivekaâall these texts one after anotherâand I have also included what I have discovered through my own investigations, bringing everything together in order to delight all those with intelligence.<a href="#fn:12" id="fnref:12" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[12]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is because it is not among the works listed here that Gorampa felt <em>Conventional Existence</em> was unknown in India.</p>
<p>As stated earlier, Mabja Changchub TsÃ¶ndrÃ¼ was amongst those earlier scholars who believed that <em>Conventional Existence</em> should be included in the Collection of Reasoning. Mabja Changchub TsÃ¶ndrÃ¼âs main teacher was Lotsawa Patsab Nyima Drakpa<a href="#fn:13" id="fnref:13" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[13]</a> who actually translated the <em>Introduction to the Middle Way</em> from Sanskrit into Tibetan, as the translatorâs colophon at the end of the text says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>â¦by the Indian abbot Tilaka Kalasha and the Tibetan translator, the monk Patsab Nyima Drakâ¦.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And, what is more, Mabja Changchub TsÃ¶ndrÃ¼ was not just an average student; he was one of the four great disciples of Patsab Nyima Drakpa, the so-called âfour sonsâ of Patsab , i.e., Geshe Putowa from Central Tibet, Sokpa Yeshe Jungne from Changthang, and Tsangpa SarbÃ¶ and Mabja Changchub TsÃ¶ndrÃ¼ from Tsang.<a href="#fn:14" id="fnref:14" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[14]</a></p>
<p>So it seems strange that one of the principal students of this great Tibetan translator who worked in collaboration with an Indian scholar to translate CandrakÄ«rtiâs text would consider a non-existent text to exist, and, not only that, but also for it to be the work of NÄgÄrjuna, and to be included within his Collection of Reasoning. If there were a reason to doubt the existence of the text in India or its authorship, Mabja Changchub TsÃ¶ndrÃ¼ would surely have been aware of it. There is no obvious reason why he would endorse a spurious text, or its subject matter, or why he might wish to see it included in the Collection of Reasoning. Lotsawa Patsab Nyima Drakpa was one of the great translators and Mabja Changchub TsÃ¶ndrÃ¼ was his direct disciple. They would certainly have known whether or not there was a text by Ärya NÄgÄrjuna called <em>Conventional Existence</em>. And they would certainly not have attributed existence to such a text if there were no grounds for doing so. This must be our conclusion too, if we investigate the matter. Hence, Gyalse Shenpen Taye, the Omniscient Longchenpa and others include <em>Conventional Existence</em> in the Collection of Reasoning and the reasons for its exclusion provided by Gorampa may be considered insufficient.</p>
<p>The <em>Treasury of Secret Mantra Scripture</em><a href="#fn:15" id="fnref:15" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[15]</a> is a text belonging to the category of terma related to the cycle of Deshek DÃ¼pa, and it includes statements by Vimalamitra, Guru Rinpoche, Namkhe Nyingpo and Vairotsana. This text also refers to a six-fold Collection of Reasoning, but it gives the sixth text as <em>Beyond All Fear</em>.<a href="#fn:16" id="fnref:16" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[16]</a> According to Indian scholars and the earlier Tibetan commentators <em>Beyond All Fear_is a work of Ärya NÄgÄrjuna. Nevertheless, it is a commentary on the </em>Root Verses on the Middle Way<em>, and therefore differs from the other body-lilke or branch-like treatises of the collection. All the same, earlier scholars considered it an âauto-commentaryâ to the </em>Root Verses_composed by NÄgÄrjuna himself. More recently however, Gorampa and others have expressed doubts about this, primarily because the text includes a citation from Äryadevaâs <em>Four Hundred Verses</em>.<a href="#fn:17" id="fnref:17" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[17]</a> Äryadeva was NÄgÄrjunaâs pupil, and it seems unlikely that in commenting upon a text that he himself had written, NÄgÄrjuna would quote his own student. So there are those who doubt the attribution of <em>Beyond All Fear</em> to NÄgÄrjuna.</p>
<p>Gorampa and others who have questioned its attribution to NÄgÄrjuna have also expressed further misgivings about <em>Beyond All Fear</em>. Why, they ask, would CandrakÄ«rti have composed his <em>Clear Words</em> commentary to the <em>Root Verses</em> if NÄgÄrjuna himself had already composed an auto-commentary? And, furthermore, why is it that there are no quotations drawn from <em>Beyond All Fear</em> in the writings of BuddhapÄlita? The answer can only be, Gorampa and the others claim, that the text in question is not in fact a genuine work of NÄgÄrjuna.</p>
<p>Whether or not NÄgÄrjuna wrote <em>Beyond All Fear</em>, it is perhaps best not to include it in the Collection of Reasoning. It is preferable to classify it as a commentary on the <em>Root Verses</em>. If all the commentaries composed by NÄgÄrjuna were to be included in the Collection of Reasoning we would have to include his commentary on <em>Refutation of Objections</em> and other texts and we might end up with something more like an eight-fold collection!</p>
<p>There are eight commentaries on the <em>Root Verses</em> in the Tengyur, one of which is <em>Beyond All Fear</em>. There are also those by DevaÅarma, Guá¹amati, Guá¹aÅrÄ«, Sthiramati, BuddhapÄlita, BhÄvaviveka and CandrakÄ«rti. Although there is some controversy over whether or not <em>Beyond All Fear</em> is an auto-commentary (i.e. by NÄgÄrjuna himself), the fact that it is a commentary is beyond dispute. And according to the <em>Treasury of Secret Mantra Quotations</em> it is one of the six treatises in the Collection of Reasoning.</p>
<p>According to Gorampa, there are only five texts in the Collection of Reasoning.<a href="#fn:18" id="fnref:18" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[18]</a> Among these, the two likened to the body are <em>Root Verses on the Middle Way</em> and <em>Sixty Verses on Reasoning</em>. Although they are both body-like texts we can draw a distinction between the two. Some past scholars explained that the <em>Root Verses</em> teach a freedom from the eight extremes of elaboration, i.e., ceasing and arising, non-existence and eternalism, coming and going, multiplicity and singularity, whereas the <em>Sixty Verses on Reasoning</em> teaches a freedom from four extremes, i.e., arising, ceasing, existence and non-existence. Others have explained that the <em>Root Verses</em> refute the assertions of true existence made by both Buddhist proponents of true entities and non-Buddhist <em>tÄ«rthika</em> philosophers; whereas the <em>Sixty Verses on Reasoning</em> refutes only the assertions of true existence made by proponents of entities within the Buddhist tradition. Mabja Changchub TsÃ¶ndrÃ¼ explained the difference between the two texts in the following way. He said that the <em>Root Verses</em> teaches emptiness of inherent nature by means of elimination and negation; whereas the <em>Sixty Verses on Reasoning</em> teaches emptiness of inherent nature by exclusively establishing the illusory nature of the conventional.</p>
<p>In any case, these are the two âbody-like treatisesâ and the so-called âbranch-like treatisesâ extend from these.</p>
<p>According to Gorampa, the first âbranch-like treatiseâ is the âtreatise refuting the views imputed by othersâ. The âviews imputed by othersâ are the sixteen categories of words and meanings of the dialecticians, and the treatise that refutes these is <em>Crushing to Fine Powder</em>.</p>
<p>According to our own tradition, once again the two body-like treatises are the <em>Root Verses on the Middle Way</em> and the <em>Sixty Verses on Reasoning</em>. Then, among the branch-like treatises, <em>Refutation of Objections</em> is said to be an expansion of the first section of the <em>Root Verses</em> on âExamining Conditionsâ. The <em>Root Verses</em> teaches how there can be no arising of something from itself or from something other than itself, and therefore brings certainty in the non-arising of all phenomena. The proponents of entities respond by saying that if this were the case, then even MÄdhyamika reasoning is without true nature. And since this reasoning is without true nature then it is not able to refute the claims made in favour of true existence. It is therefore unreasonable, they say, to claim that all phenomena are ultimately beyond arising, or beyond the two extremes of eternalism and nihilism. It is said that <em>Refutation of Objections</em> was composed in order to refute such arguments. In the text, it is stated that from the point of view of reality itself, the MÄdhyamikas have nothing to refute, and have no reasoning by which they might do so. From the conventional perspective however, even though reasoning is not truly existent, the MÄdhyamikas are still able to refute the assertions made by the proponents of entities, rather like a magically-created, illusory army warding off attack. For example, in the first verse of the <em>Refutation of Objections</em>, it is said:<a href="#fn:19" id="fnref:19" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[19]</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If all entities are non-existent<br/>
By their very nature, then<br/>
Your words also lack reality<br/>
And can not refute true existence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In his response, NÄgÄrjuna makes such statements as:<a href="#fn:20" id="fnref:20" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[20]</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since there is nothing whatsoever to refute<br/>
I do not refute anything.<br/>
Therefore when you say that I refute<br/>
That itself is incorrect.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Seventy Stanzas on Emptiness</em> is an expansion of the section of the <em>Root Verses</em> on âExamining the Conditionedâ, which includes a discussion of how arising, dwelling and ceasing cannot be established. The proponents of true entities respond to this by pointing out that in many profound sutras taught by the Buddha, it is stated that conditioned phenomena are subject to arising, dwelling and ceasing. The MÄdhyamika replies that this is true only from the mistaken viewpoint of the conventional. This is the essence of the discussion found in the <em>Seventy Stanzas on Emptiness</em>.</p>
<p>So <em>Refutation of Objections</em> and <em>Seventy Stanzas on Emptiness</em> are direct extensions from the body-like treatises.</p>
<p>Gorampa, as it was said earlier, identifies only five texts in the Collection of Reasoning. The omniscient Longchenpa identifies six texts, and his list accords with that of Mabja Changchub TsÃ¶ndrÃ¼.</p>
<p>Among the New Translation schools, the Gelugpas claim that the <em>Precious Garland</em> is the sixth text in the collection. Gorampa opposed this by pointing out that the <em>Precious Garland</em> is classified as advice, and therefore belongs to the Collection of Advice, not the Collection of Reasoning. In CandrakÄ«rtiâs <em>Clear Words</em>, for instance, which I quoted earlier, it is referred to as âthe _Advice of the Precious Garland_â.</p>
<p>In any case, whether five or six texts are included, this is what is known as Ärya NÄgÄrjunaâs Collection of Reasoning.</p>

<p>There so-called âFour Sons of Patsabâ are referred to in a verse of Taktsang Lotsawa: </p>

<p>As regards the Great Middle Way, the supreme tradition of Nagarjuna,<br/>
The excellent clarifications made by Candra[kÄ«rti], translated by Nyima [Drak],<br/>
Came down to the four sonsâ¦. </p>

<p>There are different ways of listing them. According to one, they were: (1) Gangpa Sheâu, who was learned in the words, (2) Tsangpa Dregur (<span class="TibetanInlineEnglish">à½à½à½à¼à½à¼à½ à½à¾²à½ºà¼à½¦à¾à½´à½¢à¼ </span>or <span class="TibetanInlineEnglish">à½à½à½à¼à½à¼à½ à½à¾²à½ºà¼à½¦à¾à½´à½¢à¼</span>), who was learned in the meaning, (3) Mabja Changchub TsÃ¶ndrÃ¼, who was learned in both words and meaning, and (4) Shangthang Sakpa Yeshe Jungne, who was learned in neither words nor meaning. Shakya Chokden names Tsangpa SarbÃ¶ (<span class="TibetanInlineEnglish">à½à½à½à¼à½à¼à½¦à½¢à¼à½¦à¾¦à½¼à½¦à¼</span>) as the son who was learned in the words and Daryulwa Rinchen Drak as the son learned in the meaning.
